<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The purpose of the system is to allow users to easily create, edit and visualise Knowledge Graphs from imported files. The editor will be built to allow for a more user-friendly and visually appealing interface than is currently available. 


Here's why:
* There exist certain systems that provide some aspects of functionality of the project. These systems however lack a GUI that is easy to learn and visually appealing.
* Current Systems are unintuitive for non-tech literate people to use and require a strong background of understanding the systems and files in which they are trying to use to create KGâ€™s.

### Built With

* [Vue 2.0](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)
* [WebVowl](http://visualdataweb.de/webvowl//#opts=doc=0;editorMode=true;\#iri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SemanGit/SemanGit/master/Documentation/ontology/semangitontology.ttl)

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
<p align="center"><img src="images/DynamicModel.png" alt="Logo">
</p>
This particular sequence is a sequence where the user uploads a Schema or Ontology. The system then displays the KG. The user then selects an object from the ontology and defines any relationship that object has to another or defines an attribute of the selected object. The system updates the attributes and relationships of the object, the system can export the updated schema as JSON.
